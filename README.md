# Anx

Anx is a modern statically-typed programming language written in C++.

**Note: Anx requires LLVM >= 15.0.7 in order to build properly (llvm-config must be available).**

Anx is an experimental language that seeks to provide the quality-of-life features of more dynamic languages without the performance penalties typically associated with them.

Visit `design.md` for more information about the philosophies guiding Anx.

Please note that Anx is still in its early stages of development, and there are several key language features that are still being prototyped.
For a peek at features in development, see the `test` directory.
